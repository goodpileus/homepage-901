        <h2>I love to rest!</h2>

        <p>A resting position or rest position is a default human position or pose assumed (typically deliberately) when a person is not engaged in an activity that demands some other pose, or between poses.</p>

        <div class="centered"><img src="haymakers.jpg" alt="a painting of haymakers resting"></div>

        <p>Common resting positions of the body include kneeling, leaning, lying, sitting, and squatting. In microgravity, the relaxed human body naturally assumes neutral body posture.</p>
